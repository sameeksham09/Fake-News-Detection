# Fake-News-Detection

The Fake News Detection Web Application combines the power of machine learning, natural
language processing (NLP), and data analysis to provide users with a reliable tool for
evaluating the credibility of news articles. By harnessing the vast amount of data available
and applying sophisticated algorithms, our system aims to analyze the content, context, and
historical patterns associated with news articles to determine their authenticity.
Two key components of this
analysis are the plotting of a confusion matrix and the comparison of accuracy across
different models, facilitating the selection of the best model for the final prediction.Furthermore, our Fake News Detection Web Application compares the accuracy of different
models to determine the most effective one for the final prediction.
